# 9hrWorkPlanner-AWY

## Purpose

 The purpose of this project was to build a work day scheduler with time blocks for each hour of the work day. The schedule was to display the current day at the top of the page when it is loaded. The timeblocks should be editable so the user is able to add text to the timeblock. The text event should be stored in local storge and remain on the page when refreshed. The timeblocks are to be displayed with color codes indicating past, present, and future. Starter code was provided in html and css so we needed to create the javascript to complete the project. We were to utilize third party API's as practice for what we covered in class the previous week.
