# 9hrWorkPlanner-AWY

## Purpose

 The purpose of this project was to build a work day scheduler with time blocks for each hour of the work day. The schedule was to display the current day at the top of the page when it is loaded. The timeblocks should be editable so the user is able to add text to the timeblock. The text event should be stored in local storge and remain on the page when refreshed. The timeblocks are to be displayed with color codes indicating past, present, and future. Starter code was provided in html and css so we needed to create the javascript to complete the project. We were to utilize third party API's as practice for what we covered in class the previous week. 


 ## Description

 My project comes close to meeting the requirements, but again falls short. I was not able to figure out how to attach an event listener to the save button for each time block or have the text remain when the page is refreshed. This is the same asspect I failed on in the last project and I have not been able to figure out how it works. However, with the help of my tutor I was able to create the time blocks, with the hour designation and save buttons on the end. The time blocks also display the past, present, and future with the correct colors.
