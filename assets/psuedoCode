User Story
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events per

#### set any global variables needed for the planner

#### Construct current day using jquery format $("#currentDay").text(currentDay.format("dddd, MMMM Do YYYY, h:mm:ss a"));

#### Create nine time blocks, one for each hour of the work day, 9am thru 5pm.

#### HTML?  Maybe use textarea element-with 9 rows and 3 columns- inside div tags for the timeblock structure. Left column could be used for the label, middle column for the textarea, right column for the save button. 

#### Utilise the Bootstrap, Fontawesome, and Googlefont links provided in the html to create the main container, and the nine timeblocks for the planner.

#### Each timeblock must be able to accept text entry.

#### Create a function to indicate by color wether each time block is past, present, or future?

#### Create a save event for each timeblock that saves the event in local storage.

#### The saved events must persist when the page is refreshed.
